### TDD: Test-Driven Development

- Write test before implementation of code
- Forces developer to think about the requirements before implementation
- Bugs are spotted early

### Process:

1. Write failing test.
2. Implement code that makes the test pass.
3. Refactor and repeat.

### Unit Testing Advantages

- Validate the smallest units of software.
- Find bugs easy and early.
- Save time and money.
- Can force developers to write better and cleaner code.

### Dependency Injection

- Less tightly coupled classes.
- Separation of concerns.
- No need to manually create the instance, we get it handed to us.
